# Dotfiles

To fire up the whole thing run the following:

`cd $HOME && git clone git@github.com:npazosmendez/.dotfiles.git && $HOME/.dotfiles/.init/run`

## Todo
 * Double run proof
 * Add pip packages (and envs?)
 * include zsh and oh my zsh
 * check this out https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestionsi
 * include rc files in repo instead of creating them with init
