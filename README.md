# Dotfiles

To fire up the whole thing run the following:

`cd $HOME && git clone git@github.com:npazosmendez/.dotfiles.git && $HOME/.dotfiles/.init/run`

## Todo
 * Handle more gracefully the case where tmux and vim folders already exist
 * Firefox script
 * Colors, bitch
 * Add 'easy_install trash' command somewhere
 * Fish looks sexy, maybe we could give it a look? (https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/7/simplify-linux-command-line-fish-shell) (Themes: Tomorrow Night, Bay Cruise)
 * Cool vim plugins (syntastic, fugitive?)
 * Vim extra stuff? (multiple cursor replacement?)
 * super cd
 * prompt that starts on project root
 * super clean
 * tabs on vim! that'd be cool
